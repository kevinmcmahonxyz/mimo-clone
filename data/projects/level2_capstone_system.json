  "description": "Build a movie theater ticket pricing system that calculates costs based on age, day of the week, and number of tickets. This capstone project integrates conditionals, loops, and logical operators to create a practical real-world application. You'll handle user input validation, apply different pricing rules, and generate itemized receipts.",
