  "description": "Build a travel advisor app that fetches random weather data, saves trip information to JSON, and provides packing recommendations. This capstone project integrates imports, the random module for simulating weather data, and JSON for data persistence. Users will learn how real apps combine multiple modules to create practical functionality.",

    "Import and use multiple Python modules",
    "Generate random data with the random module",
    "Work with JSON for data storage and retrieval",
    "Combine multiple concepts into a cohesive application",
