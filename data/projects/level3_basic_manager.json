  "description": "Build a simple music playlist manager that lets you create a playlist, add songs, remove songs, and display your collection. This project teaches you how to work with lists in Python - creating them, adding and removing items, accessing specific songs, and looping through your entire playlist.",

    "Create and initialize lists",
    "Add items to lists using append",
    "Remove items from lists using remove",
    "Access list items using indexing",
    "Iterate through lists with for loops"
