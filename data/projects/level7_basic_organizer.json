  "description": "Build a music playlist organizer that cleans up song titles, sorts them alphabetically, and formats them nicely. You'll use string methods to clean data, list comprehensions to transform it, and f-strings to display formatted output. This simulates real-world data cleaning tasks that developers do constantly.",

    "Use string methods to clean and format text data",
    "Apply list comprehensions to transform lists efficiently",
    "Use f-strings for formatted output",
    "Practice split and join methods on strings",
