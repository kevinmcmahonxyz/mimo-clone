  "description": "Build a movie night planner that helps a group of friends find movies everyone wants to watch. We'll use sets to find common preferences, dictionaries to track movie details, and tuples to store ratings. This practical app demonstrates how these data structures work together to solve real problems.",
  "learning_goals": [
    "Use sets to find common elements between collections",
    "Store structured data in dictionaries with multiple key-value pairs",
    "Work with tuples to represent fixed data like ratings",
    "Apply set operations like intersection and union",
    "Use dictionary methods to access and display data"
