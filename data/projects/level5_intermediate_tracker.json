  "description": "Build a recipe ingredient tracking system that helps you manage multiple recipes and find common ingredients. You'll create recipes using dictionaries, track ingredient quantities, and use set operations to compare ingredients across recipes. This project simulates a real cooking app feature where you can see which ingredients you need for multiple dishes.",
  "learning_goals": [
    "Use dictionaries to store structured recipe data with ingredients and quantities",
    "Work with tuples to represent ingredient information",
    "Apply set operations to find common and unique ingredients across recipes",
    "Use dictionary methods to access and manipulate recipe data"
