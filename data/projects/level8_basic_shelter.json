  "description": "Build a pet shelter management system using classes! You'll create a Pet class to represent animals in a shelter, then extend it with inheritance to create a Dog class with special behaviors. This project demonstrates how classes help organize real-world data (like pet information) and how inheritance lets us create specialized versions of classes.",
