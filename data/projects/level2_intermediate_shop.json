  "description": "Build a coffee shop ordering system that takes customer orders, calculates prices based on size and add-ons, and keeps track of daily sales. This project combines conditionals to handle different drink sizes and options, loops to process multiple orders, and logical operators to validate customer choices.",

    "Use if/elif/else to make decisions based on user input",
    "Apply comparison and logical operators to validate choices",
    "Use while loops to process multiple orders",
    "Combine multiple conditions with logical operators",
    "Accumulate values across iterations"
