  "description": "Build a music playlist manager that lets you create a playlist, add songs, remove songs, and display your collection. This project teaches you how to work with lists in Python by creating a practical tool for organizing music. You'll use list creation, adding and removing items, accessing specific songs, and iterating through your playlist.",

    "Create and initialize lists to store data",
    "Add items to lists using append() and insert()",
    "Remove items using remove() and pop()",
    "Access list items using indexing and slicing",
