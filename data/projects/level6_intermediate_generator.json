  "description": "Build a motivational quote generator that combines random selection with data handling! You'll import the random and json modules to select random quotes from a collection, format them beautifully, and save user favorites. This project teaches you how to work with multiple modules together and handle structured data - essential skills for real-world applications.",

    "Use random.choice() to select random items from lists",
    "Work with json.dumps() to convert data to JSON format",
    "Combine different modules to create a complete application",
